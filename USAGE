== Rails 2.3.x ==

edit application_controller.rb
  helper RailsCaddyHelper if %w(development staging).include? RAILS_ENV
  layout nil
  
edit config/environments/development.rb -- DO NOT MAKE THIS AVAILABLE TO PRODUCTION!!!
  config.gem "rails-caddy"
  
  # after initializer block --- note, this should really only go in 
  require 'rails-caddy'
  require_dependency 'application'
  RailsCaddy.init!
  
add just before you close your body tag in your layout (it's actually unimportant where you place it, as long as it's in the body):
  <%= rails_caddy %>

== Rails 2.2.x, 2.1.x ==

add require 'rails-caddy/tasks' to bottom of Rakefile
rake caddy:routes:install

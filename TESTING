Much of the RailsCaddy code itself has been tested, but the coverage for very specific versions of rails is not automated.

== Open Questions ==
* How do I automate this testing?  Will Cucumber help me to set this up?
* I need to write tests to ensure that our helpers, et al are not actually loaded in production mode....we want to avoid having if RAILS_ENV all over the place where we include this stuff....

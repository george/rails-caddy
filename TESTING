* I need to write tests to ensure that our helpers, et al are not actually loaded in production mode....we want to avoid having if RAILS_ENV all over the place where we include this stuff....
* Need to figure out a way to marry the views and their POSTs....webrat + selenium was a no-go as of April 11, 2009.  I'll consider rewriting webrat to serve my purposes, but that's a pretty deep rabbit hole from my initial investigation.
